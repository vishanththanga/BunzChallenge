# BunzCourt- Winners of the UofT Blockfest!

## What It Does
bunzCourt is an IOS App that can be integrated with the BUNZ app. Using both an exchange and arbitration smart contract, if a buyer finds defects or issues with a product. They can file a complaint and take the seller to a decentralized court, making the situation as fair as possible for both parties.

Initial Transactions: 

Assuming a 100 Btz bike, the buyer sends 50 Btz to the escrow contract and sends 50 Btz to the seller. If there is a dispute, both the buyer and seller have to stake 15 Btz, and the three arbitrators have to stake 10 Btz.

First Case: 

The buyer gets their 15 staked Btz back, and gets 50 Btz from the escrow. The 15 Btz from the staked amount the seller put down is divided up evenly among the arbitrators as a reward meaning they get a reward of 5 Btz each. 

Second Case:

The buyer gets their 15 staked Btz back, and gets 50 Btz from the escrow. If we were to divide the 15 Btz from the staked amount the seller put down up evenly among the two arbitrators as a reward they would get a reward of 7.5 Btz each, which would not make sense because the arbitrators would be getting paid more for being somewhat certain (66%) in comparison to 100% certain. So, they will still be getting the same reward, but the extra collective 5 Btz will be stored in a Btz fund that can be drawn upon in extenuating situations when the arbitrators all decide that the buyer may need more funds than the 50 Btz. The third arbitrator that made the incorrect decision is punished, losing their 10 staked Btz. This will go into the Bunz fund as well.

Third Case:

The buyer loses their staked Btz and has to pay up for the seller’s staked Btz (meaning they lose a total of 30 Btz). The seller gets the 50 Btz from the escrow contract, leaving them with 100 Btz. The 15 Btz that the buyer lost from initially staking is divided equally among the three arbitrators. 

Fourth Case:

The buyer loses their staked Btz and has to pay up for the seller’s staked Btz (meaning they lose a total of 30 Btz). The seller gets the 50 Btz from the escrow contract, leaving them with 100 Btz. If we were to divide the 15 Btz from the staked amount the seller put down up evenly among the two arbitrators as a reward they would get a reward of 7.5 Btz each, which would not make sense because the arbitrators would be getting paid more for being somewhat certain (66%) in comparison to 100% certain. So, they will still be getting the same reward, but the extra collective 5 Btz will be stored in a Btz fund that can be drawn upon in extenuating situations when the arbitrators all decide that the buyer may need more funds than the 50 Btz. The third arbitrator that made the incorrect decision is punished, losing their 10 staked Btz. This will go into the Bunz fund as well.
